## HoughTransformCircle
Find circular holes using the Hough transform.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event. 
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.9.0 is required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator in AppStudio 3.0 or higher can be used.
